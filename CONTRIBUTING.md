# 💁‍♂️ Contributing to LUKSO dApp Boilerplate

Thank you for considering contributing to the LUKSO dApp Boilerplate! People like you make the LUKSO ecosystem an excellent place for developers to start building quickly and innovate.

## Getting Started

1. Create a fork of this repository.
2. Clone your repository to make changes.
3. Follow the installation within the [README.md](./README.md)

## Making Changes

1. **Create a separate branch**: For each new feature, docs, or fix, create a new branch in your fork like the following structure: `feature/feature-name` or `fix/issue-fix`, `docs/added-content`. The naming helps organize your contributions and separates them from your main branch.
2. **Commit your changes**: After running `npm run build` and applying styles using `prettier`, you can commit your local changes to your branch. Please ensure that changes are regularly pulled from the `main` branch of the original repository to stay up-to-date and avoid conflicts.
3. **Submit a pull request**: Once your changes are ready and tested, you can push the latest changes to your GitHub fork and `submit a pull request` to this repository. Please provide a clear and detailed explanation of the changes and why they are needed. Include any relevant `issue numbers`.
4. **Review Process**: The project maintainers will review your pull request. Be open to feedback and be prepared to make further changes if requested. Once approved, a maintainer will `merge` your changes into the `main` branch.

## Contribution Guidelines

To ensure a smooth contribution process for everyone, please follow these guidelines:

- **Maintain Generality**: This repository is designed as a generic foundation for developers to start building dApps efficiently within the LUKSO ecosystem. Contributions should enhance the boilerplate's utility without introducing features too specific to particular projects or use cases. Please **do not include** branding, names, logos, addresses, or assets specific to individual projects.
- **Ensure Broad Utility**: While contributions are encouraged to add value and improve the boilerplate, they should not include functionality tailored to specific projects or applications. The goal is to keep the boilerplate versatile and applicable to various dApps.
- **Follow Code Styles**: Follow the coding conventions used throughout the project, including indentation, naming conventions, and comments.
- **Build and Test**: Ensure your code does not break the existing functionality. Add tests for any new features or fixes when possible. Any upcoming features should not break existing components or contexts.
- **Create Documentation**: Add or update any relevant documentation with your changes, especially if adding new features or changing existing functionality.
